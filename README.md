# scb_helper
Function to calculate variables for the illinois flexibility test (A.K.A. IFIT, SCB, Semi-Circular Bend, etc.). Function is specific to a proprietary output csv but could be reworked for comma-separated text files containing load-displacement data from other sources.
The function takes a path to the csv file and returns all calculated parameters from AASHTO T 105, the standard method for measurement of Fracture Energy and Illinois Fracture Index of an asphalt mixture.
